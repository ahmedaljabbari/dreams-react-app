    "content":"A few nights ago, I found myself at my desk at home studying for a test of some sort. I looked out the window and saw that my house was in a large sandbox. Immediately, I opened the window to get a better look at the environment and a giant hand (which, for some reason, I concluded to be my brother's) came down and picked me up. At this moment, I woke up in a panic and, after a few seconds, realized that I had been dreaming. Then, I went back to bed and slept peacefully the rest of the night."

I was sitting in a lounge chair in a doctor's office, and I felt fine, but when I looked in the mirror my arms were completely deformed because I had broken them.

The doctor started cutting into my throat through my mouth and said he was taking out my tonsils."

    "Genre": "Mystery",
    "content":"In this dream I awoke at a hotel and for some reason I was traveling downstairs to ask my parents a question. They were in the pool area on the first floor but once I got down to them (via stairs) I realized that I had forgotten something. I don't know what I had forgotten but I knew I had to return to my room. On the way back up to my room on the 12th floor I took the elevator. Why I didn't take it down I don't know. Inside the elevator was an operator and a little kid sitting on a bench. In the middle of the elevator there was a large dial that resembled a clock and the operator told me that I had to visualize in my mind the floor I wanted to go to in order to get there."

Told em I was suicidal but not willing for it to be by my hand so they ODed me on barbiturates or whatever it is. I went to some lovely place in the mountains with the most beautiful current and the water and rocks were so gorgeous. That's where I got fitted for a coffin. I got into the coffin and they gave my the injection. I choked once and saw all the stars in the galaxy align and then I saw my body broken down and it was only for a second and then I was where people go after I guess."
